# Alien Invasion

This is my try to create a Python game based on the good-ol "Alien Invasion" game.

For now I've only created the game plan and created a base structure. Next part will be adding the aliens to the game.

I've setup the background color of the game in a different class, the player is able to move the ship from the center to the left and right part of the screen and bullets can be fired (max 3 bullets). Also those bullets do not only dissapear but will be removed because they are no longer needed.
